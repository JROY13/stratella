# Legal documents

This directory contains the HTML shown on the `/terms` and `/privacy` routes.

## Updating copy

- `tos.html` feeds the Terms of Service at `/terms`.
- `privacy.html` feeds the Privacy Policy at `/privacy`.

Only the content inside each file's `<body>` tag is rendered. Update the text in these files to modify the live pages.

If you add new assets, keep filenames and paths stable and run the test suite to ensure links still work.
